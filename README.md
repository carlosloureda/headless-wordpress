# Wordpress Headless (with NextJs)

This is more a work & show while I am learning WP and Headless using:

- WpGraphql
- NextJS

We are builing a `boilerplate` for our company **webstantly**, this is the **canary** version to test and learn.

## Installation

- For the **frontend** This is a `nextjs` bootstrapped project, so download this repository to your local machine:

```sh
cd [project_folder]
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

- For the **backend** we are going to use Wordpress, I will leave a list of WP plugins and configuration on a section of this README, but also a **.zip** file to import a pre-installed wordpress version to easily hook up. (check `backend` folder for this)

- You need to have some **environment** variables defined, copy the **.env-EXAMPLE** file and rename it to **.env.local** and add the proper configuration variables.
